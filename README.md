# Avia Amore
We have created a website that shows a list of small airplanes that is styled via flex box. However, there is a problem. We need the page to be responsive to different screen sizes.


**GOAL**: Size down your window to below `768px`. Using media queries and WITHOUT affecting the larger screen (above `768px`), edit the CSS to create the design shown in the table below.
  - Make sure the margins line up so that the content aligns all at the left and the items are spaced out evenly as they should be.
